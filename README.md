Windows 8, 8.1 start screen colors into desktop application
==========================================================

This repository shows a possible (unofficial) approach in retrieving the start screen colors (accent color, background color etc.) into a desktop WPF application using the .NET Framework.

I was inspired to create such a sample project when researching the possible ways to achieve the desired behavior into a WPF application and make it into a Windows 8 start screen theme aware application. A similar approach is used in [this library](http://win8lib.codeplex.com/ "http://win8lib.codeplex.com/") and you can as easily download it and add its assembly in your project. The idea of this repository is to provide a way to retrieve the mentioned start screen colors without the need to add additional libraries to your project.
